# Secret-Code-Language
a project where you can put in a string and it converts it into an encoded message and vice versa. A small and fun project for my journey towards improving my proficiency in python :)

EnCoding:
if the word contains atleast 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end now append three random characters at the starting and the end
else, simply reverse the string

Decoding:
if the word contains less than 3 characters, reverse it
else, remove 3 random characters from start and end. Now remove the last letter and append it to the beginning

the program asks whether you want to code or decode...
